# Titanic - Machine Learning Comparison

This project applies and compares several supervised machine learning algorithms on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, and class.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Task: Binary classification
- Target variable: `Survived`

## Models used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Simple Neural Network

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The performance of all models is compared to identify the most robust approach for this dataset.
